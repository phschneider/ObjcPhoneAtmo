During the Term, and subject to Developer’s compliance with all terms and conditions of these Terms, Crashlytics will provide Developer with access to the Services. As part of the implementation process, Developer will identify a user name and password that will be used to set up Developer’s account. Developer will be responsible and liable for the acts or omissions of any person who accesses the Services using passwords or access procedures provided to Developer.

During the Term, and subject to all terms and conditions of these Terms, Crashlytics grants Developer a nonexclusive, nontransferable right and license (without right to sublicense) to (a) access and use the Services (including the Background Materials (as defined below) necessary to use the Services), solely for Developer’s internal business purposes and (b) download, install and use a reasonable number of copies of the Crashlytics software development kit (the “SDK”) and any tools provided as part of the SDK, including, but not limited to, any plugins (collectively, the “Software”) solely in connection with Developer’s authorized use of the Services. Developer may use the Services and the Software for the sole purposes of (i) enabling users of their applications, including Beta Testers, to access and use Beta Applications, (ii) obtaining information regarding the installation, use of and engagement with, and the functionality of Developer’s applications, including reporting on errors or bugs (collectively, “Performance Data”), (iii) improving the functionality of Developer’s applications and related products and services, and (iv) communicating with users, including Beta Testers, about Developer’s applications. Developer’s access and use of the Services shall also comply with all other conditions set forth in all documentation, instructions, end user guides and other documents regarding the Services and Software, in each case that is provided or made available by Crashlytics to Developer in electronic or other form (collectively, “Documentation”). Developer shall comply with all (a) applicable laws, rules and regulations, and (b) any applicable third-party terms, including any third-party terms applicable to Developer’s development and distribution of any application operating on the Android or iOS mobile operating systems, or any other mobile operating system upon which the application is made available and upon which Crashlytics makes the Services available to Developer. Restrictions. Developer shall not directly or indirectly (a) use the Services or any of Crashlytics’s Confidential Information (as defined below) to create any service, software or documentation that is substantially the same or has similar functionality as the Services, (b) disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or use any other means to attempt to discover any source code, algorithms or trade secrets underlying the Services or Background Materials (defined below), except and only to the extent these restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law, (c) encumber, sublicense, transfer, distribute, rent, lease, time-share or use any Crashlytics Properties (as defined below) in any service bureau arrangement or otherwise for the benefit of any third party, (d) adapt, combine, create derivative works of or otherwise modify any Crashlytics Properties, or (e) use or allow the transmission, transfer, export, re-export or other transfer of any product, technology or information it obtains or learns in connection with Developer’s use of the Services in violation of any export control or other laws and regulations of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction.

From time to time, Crashlytics may solicit from Developer or Developer may make, in its sole discretion, suggestions for changes, modifications or improvements to the Services or any other feedback related to Crashlytics or the Services (collectively, “Developer Feedback”). All Developer Feedback shall be solely owned by Crashlytics (including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto) and shall also be Crashlytics’s confidential information. Developer hereby assigns all of its right, title and interest in and to any Developer Feedback to Crashlytics and acknowledges that Crashlytics has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Developer Feedback in any manner, without attribution, and without any obligations or compensation to Developer.

Developer Data. Developer hereby grants Crashlytics a nonexclusive, license-fee free and royalty-free right and license to access, copy, distribute, process and use all information, data and other content provided by Developer, including, without limitation any Beta Application that Developer makes available for testing through the Services any other information, data, or other content provided by Developer, as well all information, data, and other content otherwise received by Crashlytics in connection with Developer’s authorized use of the Services (collectively, “Developer Data”) solely for the purpose of providing the Services and as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms.

Access by Beta Testers; EULA. Developer shall provide to Crashlytics the contact information of any user of Developer’s application(s) whom Developer intends to invite to become a Beta Tester. Developer is solely responsible for determining which users will receive an invitation to become a Beta Tester, and for ensuring the accuracy of any user contact information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (“Developer EULA”); provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with the Terms and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (“Standard EULA”). If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers that is applicable to Developer’s Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers’ use of the Beta Application shall be subject to the Standard EULA. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to Developer’s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the Developer to collect information relating to performance of Developer’s applications, including, without limitation, device state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn on features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g., a user’s e-mail address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement with and functionality of Developer’s applications, and to communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not enable the collection or use of personally identifiable information by way of applications directed at children under 13 via the Services or provide any personally identifiable information collected via such applications to Crashlytics. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy policy (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about its users and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users’ activity and otherwise collect information from users. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including, without limitation, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Crashlytics may, at its sole discretion from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, audit Developer Data to verify compliance.

Developer is responsible for providing (a) all equipment, subscriptions and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems, servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the Services at its facility (collectively, “Developer Systems”). Developer shall ensure that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.

Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any other problems which are related to (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics’s facilities or control.

Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means, with respect to Crashlytics, all financial, business or technical information disclosed by or for Crashlytics in relation to these Terms that is of a nature that should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary. Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms, neither party receiving Confidential Information hereunder (“Recipient”) may use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder (“Discloser”) without Discloser’s prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser’s Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient’s employees, contractors and agents (“Representatives”) with access to Discloser’s Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of these Terms and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Recipient can demonstrate is (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to Discloser, (c) generally available to the public without breach of these Terms or (d) independently developed by it without reference to or use of any of Discloser’s Confidential Information and without any violation of any obligation of these Terms. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser’s request at any time, Recipient shall return all of Discloser’s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other’s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order.

Proprietary Rights. As used in these Terms: “Background Materials” means all ideas, concepts, inventions, systems, platforms, software (including all Software), interfaces, tools, utilities, templates, forms, Report Formats, techniques, methods, processes, algorithms, know-how, trade secrets and other technologies and information that are used by Crashlytics in providing the Services and Results (including any correction, improvement, derivative work, extension or other modification to the Services made, created, conceived or developed by or for Crashlytics, including at Developer’s request or as a result of feedback provided by Developer to Crashlytics); “Reports” means the reports, charts, graphs and other presentation in which the Results are presented to Developer; “Report Formats” means the formatting, look and feel of the Reports; and “Results” means the work products resulting from the Services that are delivered to Developer by Crashlytics through the Services, and which are based on the Developer Data. For the sake of clarity, Results shall expressly exclude all Background Materials. Developer shall own all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) in and to feedback, suggestions, ideas or other materials and information provided by Beta Testers with respect to any Beta Application (“User Feedback”), the Results and Developer Data. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the Results will be presented to it in a Report, the Report Format of which is Confidential Information and proprietary to Crashlytics. Developer may make a reasonable number of copies of the Reports only for its internal purposes in using the Results. Developer hereby grants to Crashlytics a license-fee free, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide right and license to (a) use the Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback, solely for purposes of providing the Services to Developer, (b) use the Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback to create aggregate measures of Services usage, engagement, and performance, and (c) use the Results and aggregated Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback to improve the Services generally and for its other business purposes.

By explicitly accepting this License Agreement, or by installing, copying, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using the Software, you are acknowledging and agreeing to be bound by the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(d) &amp;#8220;Updates&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean a modification, error correction, bug fix, new release, or other update to or for the Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="licensegrant"&gt;2. LICENSE GRANT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company may, at its sole discretion, grant you a Trial License, a Personal License, an Educational License or a Commercial Seat License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not purchased or otherwise rightfully obtained a Personal License, an Educational License or a Commercial Seat License for the Reveal Software, the Trial License Terms (2.1) are applicable to your use of the Reveal Software.

&lt;p&gt;The Company grants you a non-exclusive license to use the Software for time-limited evaluation purposes, only in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Software may be used for a period of 30 calendar days from the first time you run the Software. Upon lapse of such trial period all of or part of the functionality of the Software will be disabled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to use the Software after the trial period, you must purchase a Personal License, a Commercial Seat License or an Educational License. The Company may extend to you an expiring license key, in which event such a license key will be considered a means to extend the trial period under the Trial License Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="personallicenseterms"&gt;2.2 PERSONAL LICENSE TERMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company grants you a non-exclusive license to use the Software, only in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

&lt;p&gt;This License does not allow the Software to be activated and used on computers that are not either a) owned by you, b) owned by any fully owned subsidiary of yours, c) owned by or operated primarily by your employees or employees of any fully owned subsidiary of yours. A Commercial Seat License must be purchased for every person employed by you or employed by any fully owned subsidiary of yours wishing to use the Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This license is granted exclusively on a per-employee basis within your organisation and is not transferable to another current employee without written permission.&lt;/p&gt;
